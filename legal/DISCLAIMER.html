		This site may provide water levels that rivers are "runnable" at. <strong><i>Just because a river is deemed "running" does not mean that the river is safe for you, or anybody, to run.</i></strong>

		River conditions (Such as Gauge Height, Flow Rate, Precipitation, and Temperature) can change without warning, and <strong>may be incorrect</strong>.

		<h3>More info about gauges: </h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Virtual gauges are NOT real gauges - they are values calculated based off of other gauges. Almost all virtual gauges <strong>will fail to provide accurate data</strong> under certain conditions.</li>
			<li>USGS Flow Data is Provisional - Read more about provisional data at <a href="https://water.usgs.gov/data/provisional.html">USGS (United States Geological Survey)</a>.</li>
