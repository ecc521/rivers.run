<h1><a href = "https://rivers.run/#edclassic">Ed's Classic Runs with 100 miles of DC</a></h1>
<p>The following are some of the "Classic" trips that define the DC paddling area.  All rivers are tagged as "edclassic" for easy search.
The local paddling area is arbitrarily defined as those streams and rivers in the Index Map
of "Nearby Canoeing Streams" by Ron Canter (within 100 miles).
 This area includes fall line rapids where the piedmont meets the Atlantic coastal plane.
 It also includes the greater Blue Ridge mountains that are the eastern part of the Appalachians.
 Then there are the great river valleys and other types of streams that give the area variety.
 This eliminates the ever popular Youghiogheny, Cheat and similar extremely popular watersheds not quite local.
 ALL listed trips are scenic and in no ranked order.</p>

</ol>
<p>O.K. so maybe one of your favorites didn't make this composite list.  Running Great Falls of the Potomac is truly both beautiful and inspiring but who can watch the scenery?  Therefore most of the list candidates contain easier streams.  A few like 15 Mile Creek, Licking Creek, Broad Run, Covington River and parts of the Patuxent watershed came close and then there are the "sleepers" like Toms Creek and aptly named Sleepy Creek that don't get paddled enough to be called classic.
If you absolutely had to sample the best in a short time your list must include: Mather Gorge, Shenandoah Staircase, Sideling Hill Creek, Compton's section of the South Fork Shenandoah and the Lost River Gorge.  Did I mention the Cacapon... and then there is this section of Passage Creek...  [and don't forget the pretty but flat rivers just to the east â€“ like Trussum Pond, Del.].
